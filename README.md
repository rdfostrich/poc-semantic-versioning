# Semantic Versioning with OSTRICH

This is a prototypical proof-of-concept implementation for semantic versioned querying.
It is implemented on top of the versioned triple store, [OSTRICH](https://github.com/rdfostrich/ostrich/).
An additional layer is able to perform inferencing based on a set of rules.

The main entrypoint of this project is the `evaluate.js` file.
